Absolutely! Let’s break it down like you're learning it for the first time. Think of **insertion sort** like sorting playing cards in your hand — one card at a time, in the right place.

---

### 💡 Imagine This:
You have a messy stack of cards, and you want to sort them from smallest to biggest. You start with the first card — it’s already "sorted" because it’s just one card. Then you take the next card and **insert** it into the correct position in your sorted part.

This is exactly how **insertion sort** works!

---

## 🧠 How It Works (in plain English):
1. Start from the **second** element in the array.
2. Compare it with the element(s) before it.
3. **Shift** the bigger elements to the right.
4. Put the current element in the correct spot.
5. Keep doing this until the whole array is sorted.

### 📦 Let's say you have an array:
```java
int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 6, 2};
```

You want to sort it from smallest to biggest using **insertion sort**.

### ✅ Step-by-step Insertion Sort in Java:
```java
public class InsertionSortExample {
    public static void main(PlayWithStrings[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 6, 2};

        // Start from the second element (index 1)
        for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            int current = numbers[i]; // The number we're going to insert
            int j = i - 1;

            // Shift bigger elements to the right
            while (j >= 0 && numbers[j] > current) {
                numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j]; // Move the number to the right
                j--;
            }

            // Place the current number into the correct position
            numbers[j + 1] = current;
        }

        // Print the sorted array
        for (int num : numbers) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔍 What’s Happening in the Loop:
Let’s say `current = 3`, and the array is like:
```
[5, 3, 8, 6, 2]
 ^
```
- Compare 3 with 5 → 5 is bigger, so shift 5 right.
- Now insert 3 where 5 was:
```
[3, 5, 8, 6, 2]
```

Do that for every element in the array!

### 🧸 Why It’s Called "Insertion" Sort?
Because you're **inserting** each number into the right spot, like you're organizing books on a shelf by size.
