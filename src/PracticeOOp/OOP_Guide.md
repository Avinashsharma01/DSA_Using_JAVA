## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects and classes rather than functions and procedures. It's based on the concept of "objects" which contain data (attributes) and code (methods).

### Why OOP?
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into separate, interchangeable components
- **Reusability**: Once a class is created, it can be used multiple times
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one part don't affect other parts
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without breaking existing code

## The Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods together and controlling access
2. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing classes
3. **Polymorphism**: One interface, multiple implementations
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details

## Classes and Objects

### Class
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines:
- **Attributes** (instance variables): What the object has
- **Methods**: What the object can do
- **Constructors**: How to create the object

### Object
An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created from the class blueprint.

## Examples Organization

Each concept will have:
- **Basic Examples**: Simple, easy-to-understand code
- **Intermediate Examples**: More complex scenarios
- **Advanced Examples**: Real-world applications
- **Practice Exercises**: For hands-on learning
